# Analyzing-Police-Activity-with-Pandas
Analyzing data sets to answer interesting questions about a real data set.
Outcome: cleaning messy data, creating visualization, combining and reshaping data sets, and manipulating time series data. Giving conclusions to questions:
1. Does the gender of a driver have an impact on police behavior during a traffic stop?
2. Are you more likely to get arrested at a certain time of day?
3. Are drug-related stops on the rise?

And explore the impact of weather conditions on police behavior during traffic stops and assessing whether a data source is trustworthy
